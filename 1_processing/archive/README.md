All samples were quantified in Salmon using both a PAO1 and PA14 references.

To determine which samples are PAO1 versus PA14 we will use the mapping rate to call a sample as PAO1 if the sample has a _high_ PAO1 mapping rate.
To determine what is considered a _high_ mapping rate we will use the distribution of the mapping rates (i.e. mapping of samples against PAO1 reference and PA14 reference).
Next we will bin samples into PAO1 and PA14 compendia based on these determined thresholds.
