# # Explore secretion system genes
#
# [KEGG enrichment analysis](5_KEGG_enrichment_of_stable_genes.ipynb) found that genes associated with ribosome, Lipopolysaccharide (outer membrane) biosynthesis, citrate cycle are significantly conserved across strains.
# Indeed functions that are essential seem to be significantly conserved across strains as expected.
# However, there are also pathways like the secretion systems, which allow for inter-strain warfare, that weâ€™d expect to vary across strains but were found to be conserved (T3SS significant but not T6SS).
#
# This notebook examines the stability score of the genes in the secretion systems to determine if there is a subset of the secretion genes, related to the machinery that is conserved while others, like the secretory proteins, are more variable.

# We hypothesized that most secretion machinery genes would be conserved but that secreted proteins (i.e. effector proteins) would be less conserved. In general, the effector proteins were not included in the KEGG annotations, which is probably why these secretion systems were found to be highly stable.
#
# T6SS genes are among the most stable with the vgrG6, vgrG3, vgrG4a among the least stable. T3SS among the most stable with pscR among the least stable
#
# Need to read more about these genes and if it makes sense that they are at the bottom.
