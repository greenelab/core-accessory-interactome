# **Observations:**
# These pair plots tell us what the distribution of the genes look like in our compendia. Overall it looks like genes tend to have a heavy right tail and some genes have a spike at 0 while others don't. As expected, our example housekeeping gene doesn't have this peak since this is a gene that tends to be highly active across all samples.
#
# These pair plots also give us a rough sense for how correlated genes are. We would expect co-operonic genes to be more highly correlated compared to a random set of genes, which we do see. Some correlations appear not as strong due to the differences in scales between genes - something to consider when we are looking at correlations between genes.
