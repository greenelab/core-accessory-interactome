# Network analysis
This directory generates G-G networks by applying clustering to the correlation matrix, generated by comparing the correlation between pairs of gene expression profiles. In other words these networks represent the co-expression of _P. aeruginosa_ genes using PAO1 and PA14 compendia.

[1_correlation_analysis.ipynb](1_correlation_analysis.ipynb) Performs correlation analysis to compare the similarity between genes and applies different threshold cutoffs to determine the strength of connection between genes. This notebook also visualizes the correlation structure to inform the clustering approach used in the next notebook.

[2_get_network_communities.ipynb](2_get_network_communities.ipynb) Applies clustering methods to identify gene modules based on the correlation matrices.

[3_module_validation.ipynb](3_module_validation.ipynb) Validates generated modules.
