**Test phage reference index**
Our ultimate goal is to create 3 separate compendia by aligning *P. aeruginosa* samples to PAO1, PA14 and phage references. We can then use these compendia to start analyzing the relationship between different groups of genes (i.e. core, accessory, phage). Before we can do this we need to test the alignment of samples against these 3 references. Jake Holt (rotation student) lead the effort to process and test the alignments against PAO1 and PA14. Here, our  goal of this analysis is to test our phage reference genome alignment before we port it to the Discovery (Dartmouth computing cluster) and use it to process samples. Here, our goal is to test our phage reference genome alignment before we port it to the Discovery (Dartmouth computing cluster) and use it to process samples.

Specifically, we want to check that:
* non-pseodomonas samples align poorly to this phage reference
* pseudomonas samples with known phage genes have some nonzero expression for these phage genes aligned to the phage genome
